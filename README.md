# Queue-Implementation

A **Queue** is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. This implies that the first item to be inserted will be the first to be removed. You can also say that items are removed in the order they were inserted.



**FIFO Principle of Queue:**
* A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First come first serve).
* Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the front of the queue(sometimes, head of the queue), similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the rear (or the tail) of the queue. See the below figure.

____

Were implemented following methods.
* class constructor
* class destructor
* memory allocator
* enque method
* deque method
* front method
* rear method
* size method
* isEmpty method
* print method

Implementetation of this methods gives us basic functionalities of std::queue of standard library.
